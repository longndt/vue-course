### Setup Process

```bash
# Create new Vite + Vue app
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
# or with TypeScript
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
cd vite-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### When to Use

- Modern React development
- Large applications requiring fast builds
- TypeScript projects
- When build performance matters
- Teams comfortable with modern tooling

## Comparison of Approaches

| Feature | HTML Integration | create-vue | Vite |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------|
| **Setup Time** | Instant | ~2-3 minutes | ~1-2 minutes |
| **Learning Curve** | Minimal | Beginner-friendly | Moderate |
| **Development Speed** | Immediate | Good | Excellent |
| **TypeScript Support** | Manual setup | Built-in (with template) | Built-in |
| **Build Performance** | No build | Moderate | Very Fast |
| **Hot Reload** | Manual refresh | Good | Excellent |
| **Production Ready** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Bundle Size** | N/A | Good | Excellent |
| **Customization** | Full control | Limited (unless ejected) | Highly customizable |
| **Community Support** | N/A | Extensive | Growing rapidly |

### HTML Integration

#### Pros:
- Zero setup required
- Modern Vue 3 development
- Perfect for learning Vue basics
- Great for quick experiments
- Simple to understand
- No build tools complexity
- Works immediately in any browser

#### Cons:
- No TypeScript support
- No module system
- Limited optimization
- Not suitable for production
- No hot reloading
- Manual dependency management

### Create React App

#### Pros:
- Zero configuration setup
- Beginner-friendly
- Comprehensive toolchain included
- Stable and well-documented
- Large community support
- Opinionated best practices
- Built-in testing setup

#### Cons:
- Slower build times
- Large bundle size
- Limited customization without ejecting
- Can be overkill for simple projects
- Webpack complexity hidden but present
- Less modern than Vite

### Vite

#### Pros:
- Extremely fast development server
- Lightning-fast hot module replacement
- Modern ES modules approach
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Highly customizable
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Active development and modern architecture

#### Cons:
- Newer ecosystem (less mature)
- Requires modern browser for development
- More configuration options (can be overwhelming)
- Smaller community compared to create-vue
- Learning curve for advanced features

## Best Practices

1. Development Setup

   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up proper IDE support
   - Use Git for version control

2. Project Structure

   ```
   src/
   ├── components/  # Reusable components
   ├── assets/     # Static assets
   ├── styles/     # Global styles
   └── types/      # TypeScript types
   ```

3. Code Organization

   - One component per file
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Proper type definitions
   - Clear component hierarchy

4. Performance
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Asset optimization
   - Bundle size monitoring

## Getting Started Guide

### For Absolute Beginners
1. Start with **HTML Integration** to understand React basics
2. Move to **create-vue** for your first real project
3. Graduate to **Vite** when you need better performance

### For Experienced Developers
1. Try **Vite** for modern development experience
2. Use **create-vue** for quick prototypes or when working with beginners
3. Use **HTML Integration** for simple demos or learning new concepts

## Learning Path

### Step 1: HTML Integration
- Understand JSX syntax
- Learn component basics
- Practice with state and props
- Explore React developer tools

### Step 2: create-vue
- Learn project structure
- Understand build process
- Practice with multiple components
- Learn about testing

### Step 3: Vite Setup
- Experience modern development tools
- Learn TypeScript with React
- Understand ES modules
- Optimize for production

## Learning Objectives

After exploring these demos, you should understand:

- Three different ways to set up React applications
- Trade-offs between development speed, learning curve, and production readiness
- Modern development tooling and build processes
- TypeScript integration options
- When to choose each approach
- Basic React concepts and project structure
- Development workflow differences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### HTML Integration
- **CORS errors**: Use a local server like `python -m http.server` or Live Server extension
- **Babel not working**: Check script order and ensure Babel is loaded before your React code

#### create-vue
- **Port 3000 already in use**: Use `npm start` with different port or kill existing process
- **Build errors**: Clear `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- **Slow performance**: Consider switching to Vite for faster development

#### Vite
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're using ES module syntax
- **TypeScript errors**: Check `tsconfig.json` configuration
- **Build failures**: Verify all dependencies are properly installed
