# Lesson 3: API Integration & Data Management

## Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to integrate Vue 3 applications with backend APIs and manage data effectively. We'll cover REST API integration, data fetching patterns, error handling, and state management for complex data workflows.

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand REST API concepts and HTTP methods
- Integrate Vue 3 with Node.js/Express backends and MongoDB
- Implement proper data fetching patterns with composables
- Handle loading states, errors, and edge cases professionally
- Build CRUD operations with reactive state updates
- Manage complex application state with Pinia
- Implement search, filtering, and pagination
- Handle file uploads and media management

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Lessons 1-2
- Understanding of JavaScript ES6+ features
- Basic knowledge of HTTP and web APIs
- Familiarity with async/await and Promises

_For detailed development environment setup, see [Complete Environment Setup Guide](../setup/environment-setup.md)_

## What You'll Build

In this lesson, you'll create a comprehensive task management application that demonstrates:

- **API Integration**: Connect to a REST API for data operations
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- **Advanced Features**: Search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Error Handling**: Professional error states and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. REST API Fundamentals

- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Status codes and error handling
- Request/response patterns
- API authentication

## üîç **Knowledge Checkpoint 1**

Before diving into code, make sure you understand:

1. **What does REST stand for and why is it important?**
2. **What's the difference between GET and POST requests?**
3. **What HTTP status code indicates a successful request?**
4. **Why do we need error handling in API calls?**

_üí° Think of APIs as restaurants - you make requests (orders) and get responses (food)!_

### 2. Data Fetching Strategies

- Native fetch vs axios
- Composables for data management
- Reactive caching and background updates
- Optimistic updates with reactive state

### 3. State Management Patterns

- Local reactive state vs Pinia stores
- Loading and error states with ref/reactive
- Data synchronization with watchers
- Cache invalidation strategies

### 4. Professional UX Patterns

- Skeleton screens
- Error boundaries
- Retry mechanisms
- Offline handling

## Lab Exercises

The lesson includes 4 progressive exercises:

1. **Basic API Integration**

   - Set up API client
   - Implement basic CRUD operations
   - Handle loading and error states

2. **Advanced Data Management**

   - Create data fetching composables
   - Add search and filtering with computed properties
   - Create pagination with reactive state

3. **User Experience Enhancements**

   - Add optimistic updates
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Create skeleton screens

4. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live data updates
   - Conflict resolution

## üìä **Final Knowledge Assessment**

Complete this self-assessment to check your API integration skills:

### **API Integration (Must Know)**

- [ ] I can make GET requests to fetch data from APIs
- [ ] I understand how to send POST requests with JSON data
- [ ] I can handle API errors gracefully with try/catch
- [ ] I know how to display loading states during API calls

### **Data Management (Must Know)**

- [ ] I can manage API response data in reactive state
- [ ] I understand when to re-fetch data (watchers and lifecycle)
- [ ] I can implement basic CRUD operations
- [ ] I know how to handle form submissions to APIs

### **User Experience (Good to Know)**

- [ ] I can implement search and filtering functionality
- [ ] I understand how to show meaningful error messages
- [ ] I can create loading skeletons for better UX
- [ ] I know how to implement pagination for large datasets

### **Professional Patterns (Good to Know)**

- [ ] I understand composables for advanced data management
- [ ] I can implement optimistic updates with reactive state
- [ ] I know how to handle network errors and retries
- [ ] I understand caching strategies with Pinia

**üéØ Goal: Check at least 10/16 items before moving to Lesson 4**

### **Self-Reflection Questions**

1. What's the most challenging part of API integration?
2. How would you handle slow internet connections in your app?
3. What kind of data will your applications need to manage?

## üéì **Ready for Lesson 4?**

If you completed the assessment above and feel comfortable with API integration, you're ready to move on to [Lesson 4: Routing & Authentication](../lesson4-routing-auth/).

**Still need practice?** Consider:

- Building more complex API integrations
- Experimenting with different error handling approaches
- Adding advanced features like search and pagination
- Practicing with real APIs (not just mock data)
- **Theory**: [theory3.md](./theory/theory3.md) - Theory and concepts presentation
- **Demo Code**: Available in the demo folder
- **API Documentation**: Links to external APIs used in exercises

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll be ready for:

- **Lesson 4**: Routing, Authentication & Advanced Patterns
- **Lesson 5**: Full-Stack Integration & Production Deployment

The data management skills learned here form the foundation for building complex, production-ready Vue 3 applications.
